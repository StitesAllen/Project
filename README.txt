My Website is a personal portfoilio to submit to potential employers. 
I have four tabs each accesible from all other tabs.
The tabs are a quick bio about myself, projects I've completed, my graphic design portfolio, and my resume.
I use semantic HTML, css styling, and responsive layouts for each page. 
The responsive layout it only used in the article section for the resume and he graph design portfolio.
I have a video link in the projects tab under the golf swing FEA.
